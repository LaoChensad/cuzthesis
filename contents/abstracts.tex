    {浙江传媒学院，毕业论文，\LaTeX{}模板，注意事项}
    本文是浙江传媒学院本科毕业论文模板\texttt{cuzthesis}的使用说明文档。主要内容为介绍\LaTeX{}文档类\texttt{cuzthesis}的用法，以及撰写毕业论文的一些注意事项。

    摘要是全文的浓缩，要涵盖文章的主要内容，一般应保证字数在300以上，须包括如下三点：做了什么、如何做的、做得怎样。具体而言：\textbf{第一段}，可以用一句话概述课题背景；接着再用一两句话表明做的东西。\textbf{第二段}，可以用三五句话描述如何做的，包括做这个东西分几步（或几个模块），每步（模块）的任务，以及相邻步（或相关模块）之间的关系。\textbf{最后一段}，用两三句话概括作品的亮点，以及效果怎样，包括可能的市场反响、用户体验等等。
    
    需要注意的是，既然是全文的浓缩，就不要出现类似“本项目将要做到”或者“详情见正文”等此类语句，因其并非正文中应出现的说法（既然已经是正文的浓缩，再说详情见正文就产生了矛盾）。此外，语言上应注意言简意赅，语气上应平实无感。

    {Communication University of Zhejiang (CUZ), Thesis, \LaTeX{} Template, Advices}
    This paper is a help documentation for the \LaTeX{} class \texttt{cuzthesis}, which is a thesis template for the Communication University of Zhejiang. The main content is about how to use the \texttt{cuzthesis}, as well as some advices of writing thesis.

    Abstract is the abstraction of the whole paper, which should cover the main aspects of the paper, and should contain no less than 300 words, involving 3 aspects: what is done, how to do it, and what about the result. Specifically, \textbf{1st paragraph}, introduce the background by 1 sentence, and what is done by 1 or 2 sentence(s). \textbf{2nd paragraph}, describe how to do it by 3 to 5 sentences, including how many steps (modules) are used, what each step (module) does, and the relationship between adjacent steps (related modules). \textbf{Last paragraph}, extract the most important features of the work and its effect by 2 or 3 sentences, including possible responses of markets, user experiences, etc..
	
	Note that, since it is the abstraction of the whole paper, expressions such as "this project will ..." or "readers are refered to the body of paper for details" should be avoided, for this saying should not appear in the body of paper (now that this is the abstraction, a refering to the body of paper generates a conflict). Besides, the language should be neat, and the tone should be plain and without emotions.
